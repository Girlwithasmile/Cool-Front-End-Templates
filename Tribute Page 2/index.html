    <p1>Lata Mangeshkar was an Indian playback singer, music composer and philanthropist. She is widely considered to have been one of the greatest and most influential singers in India. Her contribution to the Indian music industry in a career spanning seven
        decades gained her honorific titles such as the "Queen of Melody", "Nightingale of India", and "Voice of the Millennium". Lata recorded songs in over thirty-six Indian languages and a few foreign languages, though primarily in Marathi, Hindi,
        and Bengali. Her foreign languages included English, Russian, Dutch, and Swahili. She received several accolades and honors throughout her career. In 1989, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was bestowed on her by the Government of India. In 2001, in
        recognition of her contributions to the nation, she was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour; she is only the second female singer, after M.S. Subbulakshmi, to receive this honour. France conferred on her its highest civilian
        award, Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honour, in 2007. She was the recipient of three National Film Awards, 15 Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards, four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards, two Filmfare Special Awards,
        the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and many more. In 1974, she was one of the first Indian playback singers to perform at Royal Albert Hall in London, UK. Her last recorded song was "Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti ki" released on 30 March 2019 as
        a tribute to the Indian Army and the Nation. At one point, she appeared in the Guinness World Records which listed her as the most recorded artist in history between 1948 and 1987.</p1>

    <p2>On 8 January 2022, Lata Mangeshkar tested positive for COVID-19 with mild symptoms and was admitted to Breach Candy Hospital's intensive care unit in Mumbai. She remained in the ICU with signs of "marginal improvement" in her health. The doctors treating
        her had taken her off the ventilator on 28 January after her health "improved marginally"; however, she was back on the ventilator on 5 February, after her health deteriorated, and was undergoing "aggressive therapy". Mangeshkar died from multiple
